# spring-rest-stack
This is the spring-rest-stack code taken from 
https://github.com/joshlong/the-spring-rest-stack.
Only the package names and hence the directories have been appropriately renamed.
Also the database is changed from h2database to mysql.
Only the web part from the code folder is put up.
